1. Open the file AbsurdRevive.lua (better use some simple code editor that can highlight syntax, but it's doable via the Notepad too).
2. There are 2 kinds of lists lists: mes1 and mes2. Each mes1 and mes2 variable has a subset (list/table) of variables, for example mes1[1], mes1[2], etc. You can add another subset for your own message style. Just don't mess up the enumeration order (1,2,3,4,5,...,n-1,n).
3. Edit them.
