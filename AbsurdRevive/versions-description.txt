1.01

100 names, 100 mes1, 100 mes2.
4 classes are supported (priest, shaman, paladin, druid).
Druid casts the Rebirth spell upon calling the addon command (/absurdrevive).

What the addon does: if your target is dead, it writes the message into the chat (/s atm), in the format [text1][%target]![name][text2], for example "This is not a vacation, %target! Santa Claws rated your death 2/10.", and casts a resurrection spell, based on a class of your character.

1.02

changed the format of messages
Now it's just [mes1 %t mes2].
Also I optimized the code, so now it's much more compact.
Added a lot of resurrection messages of different styles.
